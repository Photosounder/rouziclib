= rouziclib

This is my library of code that is common to all my different projects such as https://photosounder.com[Photosounder], https://photosounder.com/spiral/[Spiral] and https://photosounder.com/splineeq/[SplineEQ], but also lesser projects such as my minimalistic https://github.com/Photosounder/rouziclib-picture-viewer[picture viewer], my https://github.com/Photosounder/screenshot-tool[screenshot tool] or my modernised version of NASA's https://github.com/Photosounder/Voyager-Image-Decoder[Voyager Image Decoder] as well as projects you don't know about such as my private project Spacewar where all my new code is born.

== What it does

It includes some of the following:

* Fast lookup table-based fixed-point arithmetic approximations for sqrt, hypot, log2, exp2, pow, cos, atan2 (both noting angles in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn_(geometry)[turns], not radians), the Gaussian function (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e%5E-x%C2%B2[e^-x²^]) and the raised error function (https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=0.5%2B0.5erf(x)[0.5+0.5erf(x)]). Some are implemented using linear interpolation, segmented quadratic polynomial approximation or simple lookup, which offers different levels of speed/precision/memory usage tradeoffs.
* Fast polynomial lookup table-based floating-point approximations for cos, log2, exp2, pow and others.
* Original math functions such as a short Gaussian function and its integral, the short error function which I now use for filter design. I also implemented the inverse of the error function and the integral of the error function.
* Functions to draw lines, points, circles, roundrects and gradients, all antialiased with Gaussian filtering
* Functions to convert from sRGB to linear RGB for loading images and to convert from linear RGB to sRGB with optional Gaussian dithering for displaying
* Geometric functions used for computing intersections between lines, shortest the distance of a point to a line or to limit a line to a bounding box
* Blending modes like additive, subtractive, multiplicative blending and alpha blending
* Blitting of a buffer onto another, like for displaying a sprite
* An original Hue-Saturation-Luminance colour space with a Luminance that is about perceptually correct (unlike the 1931 CIE XYZ colour space which gets the weights of each colour blatantly wrong) which is used for HSL to RGB conversion and for bringing out of gamut colours (such as colours that have components brighter than 1.0) to the most appropriate representable colour
* Vector font generation, vector text rendering and a built-in minimalistic vector font that is always available. A more complete typeface is available in the link:vector_type[vector_type] directory
* Vector procedural zoomable interface elements that for instance allow you to have a fully functional button just by calling a function with all the necessary information provided as parameters (without anything stored in memory) and simply getting the return value, with no need for storage for each instance of a control, no unique IDs or anything
* Functions to conveniently do operations on point vectors (2D or 3D) or rectangles and triangles, such as generating rectangle coordinates based on position, size and offset vectors, or calculating the scaling and positioning needed to make a rectangle fit in a certain way inside another rectangle. This forms the basis of the aforementioned interface system.
* A drawing queue-based graphical system that lets the main thread queue drawing commands and then is rendered on the GPU using OpenCL or the CPU in a threaded way
* A file concatenation feature called fileball similar to tarball that I use to pack and compress many files together as one header that can be included in an executable in a portable compiler-independent way, like my vector typeface.
* Convenient directory-listing and file management features
* Built-in dependency-free loading of various image formats (https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h[JPG, PNG, BMP, PSD], TIFF, https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html[NASA]'s FITS), saving of images (32-bit TIFF, https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h[PNG, JPG, BMP]), loading of sounds (AIFF, WAVE, https://github.com/lieff/minimp3/blob/master/minimp3.h[MP3], https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_flac.h[FLAC], https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_vorbis.c[OGG]) and saving of sounds (AIFF, WAVE).
* Modified libraries such as a version of https://github.com/zywina/cfftpack[cfftpack] modified so that both single and double precision floating point FFTs can be done in the same program (not possible with the original) or a version of https://github.com/tronkko/dirent[dirent] modified to fix some path length and Unicode conversion bugs, or a cut-down version of https://github.com/nigels-com/glew[GLEW] that contains only what rouziclib needs.
* Fast tiled mipmap generation, image rescaling based on https://photosounder.com/michel_rouzic/#flattop[flat-top bilinear filtering], Gaussian blurring, an original texture compression and YUV coding/decoding in C and OpenCL.
* A system for loading and saving an application's preferences to one file but in a non-centralised way with just a simple value query being enough to add a new value in its proper place
* A sound system so that multiple functions can play sounds at the same time by providing a callback
* Functions to easily resize buffers as needed and a generic buffer system based on this with many functions that replicate how outputing to a file stream works
* Binary searching of arrays
* Functions to convert between UTF-8, UTF-16 and Unicode codepoints. A subset of these functions forms the basis for https://github.com/Photosounder/fopen_utf8[fopen_utf8] which I recommend you use if you need to fopen UTF-8 paths on Windows.
* Various functions to parse or format strings
* Various utility functions and macros
* Code for working with https://www.libsdl.org/[SDL], OpenGL, https://www.khronos.org/opencl/[OpenCL], https://github.com/clMathLibraries/clFFT[clFFT], http://openil.sourceforge.net/[DevIL], http://opencv.org/[OpenCV], https://www.ffmpeg.org/[FFMPEG], https://www.libraw.org/[LibRAW] and http://www.mpfr.org/[MPFR].

All graphical functions operate on pixels in a linear colour space. Please do not use these functions directly in a gamma-compressed colour space, instead use an intermediary linear framebuffer which you can then convert to an sRGB framebuffer using the function `convert_lrgb_to_srgb`.

== How to use it

Unusually for a library, rouziclib's code relies on macros that are defined inside your project's code. This means that rouziclib isn't entirely independently compiled. So the way to make this work is to create two files in your project, a header file which directly includes the main header, but not before you add the macros you can optionally define, and a code file which includes the aforementioned header file you just created and then includes the library's rouziclib.c. Here's how it looks:

rl.h

[source,C]
----
#ifndef H_PRL
#define H_PRL
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C" {
#endif

// these are examples of optional macros that rouziclib will then use for your project
#define COL_FRGB    // this macro makes the internal format for colour be floating-point instead of fixed-point
#define RL_SDL      // this includes SDL-using code as well as the necessary SDL files
#define RL_OPENCL   // same for OpenCL

// this defines a wrapper for fprintf_rl, so your project can use a custom fprintf-type function that can for instance output to a file
#define fprintf_rl fprintf_wrapper
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>
extern void fprintf_wrapper (FILE *stream, const char* format, ...);

#include <rouziclib/rouziclib.h>

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif
#endif
----

rl.c

[source,C]
----
#include "rl.h"

// this creates that custom printing function that all calls to fprintf_rl in rouziclib will use

void fprintf_wrapper (FILE *stream, const char* format, ...)
{
    va_list args;

    va_start (args, format);

    vfprintf (stream, format, args);    // printf to original stream
    fflush (stream);

    va_end (args);
}

#include <rouziclib/rouziclib.c>
----

I realise that this is a bit unusual, but it's pretty simple and very handy. You can for instance include rouziclib in a simple command-line C program without having to worry about dependencies as none will be included, and in another project add dependencies as you need by adding the necessary macros, so without having the recompile anything separately (as you would have to were you to use two versions of a same library compiled with different dependencies) you can have in separate projects a rouziclib with no dependencies or a rouziclib that uses SDL, DevIL, OpenCV, OpenCL, clFFT, FFMPEG and LibRAW.

** link:rouziclib/memory/generic_buffer.c[generic_buffer.c] / link:rouziclib/memory/generic_buffer.h[generic_buffer.h] +
A generic buffer is a structure that contains a buffer (usually used as a string, otherwise as a byte stream) as well as a count of how many bytes are currently used and how many are allocated. This allows for the buffer to be enlarged as needed, to avoid inefficiencies that come from running `strlen()` to know where a string ends, and to have functions that behave on strings just like on a `FILE` pointer. For instance `bufprintf()` works just like `fprintf()` except on a string (as a generic buffer), which is rather convenient, and `bufwrite()` works like `fwrite()`, which makes creating binary files in memory much easier.

** link:rouziclib/memory/comparison.c[comparison.c] / link:rouziclib/memory/comparison.h[comparison.h] +
Contains often-needed comparison functions that like `strcmp()` can be used with `qsort()` or `bsearch()`. `array_find_index_by_cmp()` uses binary searching to find an index in a pre-sorted array based on a given value.

An insert rect is a space in a string to be drawn on screen, and that space has its coordinates reported so that they can be used to insert an interface element where the space is. The width of the space is specified by combining private use Unicode codepoints that each represent a different spacing, the sum of which is the width of the space, and then a variation selector character which represents an index in an array. So for example by using the character that represents a space of 36 units, followed by the character that represents 3 units, followed by the character that represents an index of 0, I can make a space 39 units wide in some text and then by querying the insert rect at index 0 get the on-screen coordinates for that space so that I can place something there. I use it mainly for inserting text edit controls to enter a value in the middle of some text, so the text input field is automatically adjusted to be the right size and position to fit in perfectly.

== Vector typeface

The link:vector_type/[vector_type] folder contains the files that make up my vector typeface which is embedded into rouziclib. Unlike usual digital typefaces which typically define outlines using splines, with a set of different fixed weights, my typeface defines strokes, it is only made of thin straight lines and it has only one weight which is infinite thinness. Simplicity is the goal, both simplicity of design, each glyph is made of a few straight lines, no curves, no outlines, no weights, so the glyph for A is defined with 3 straight lines instead of a more typical 10 or 11 for outlines, and simplicity of implementation, as every glyph can be displayed provided only that the current display system has an implementation for `draw_line_thin()`. I currently have 4 different display systems in rouziclib (fixed-point framebuffer, floating-point framebuffer, OpenCL drawing queue and CPU multithreaded SIMD drawing queue) and every system lacks features that another system might have. With this I only need to get simple line drawing implemented to be able to display text and interface symbols that come from the typeface.

Another difference with typical computer fonts is that the files that make up my typeface are meant to be read and edited by hand (although my project Spacewar contains tools to generate glyphs, which I used mainly to make Japanese kana glyphs by tracing). I believe that readable text markup is a powerful way to represent anything, be it entire projects (like the PHA files of Photosounder), configuration files, or as in this case the data and commands needed to generate a typeface. Unlike meme formats like XML or JSON it's more readable, elegant, natural and doesn't require the use of a parsing library (little more than `sscanf()` is needed to parse my markup), it doesn't require specialised tools, the data is more portable because it's more understandable, and because it's so simple and natural it's more future-proof, a future parser can easily make use of outdated markup.

=== Structure

When rouziclib loads the typeface, it starts by loading link:vector_type/type_index.txt[type_index.txt], which itself points to 3 types of files through 3 commands.

* `range` points to a file that represents a Unicode range of glyphs. The range start and end points indicated are only there so that my glyph design tool (in Spacewar) would know in which file to put a glyph.

* `substitutions` points to the file that defines certain glyphs as being exactly another glyph. For instance the Greek &#927;, the Cyrillic &#1054; and the Armenian &#1365; all look pretty similar to the Latin O, so substitution is used. When the renderer tries to render a Cyrillic &#1054; it draws the Latin O instead, so we don't even store a copy of the substituted glyph.

* `cjkdecomp` contains commands (coded as a number) to assemble two CJK glyphs into a new one, so that the basic strokes I designed can be assembled into making any CJK glyph. Because it's a rather heavy file and that very few glyphs looked correct it's excluded from the compressed header used to embed the typeface in a program. It's based on https://github.com/amake/cjk-decomp/blob/master/cjk-decomp.txt[this file] and hopefully one day in the future I'll have a better more solid way of generating CJK glyphs.

=== Glyph notation

Let's have a look at a simple glyph, A:

```
glyph 'A'
        p1      2       0
        p2      1;2;8   2;4
        p3      0       6
        mirror  v 0     p1 p2   p4
        lines   p1 p3 p4
        lines   p2 p5
        bounds  -1;9 1;9
```

There are many things to explain. The shape of the glyph A is defined by only 3 points, this is because it's a symmetrical glyph, it would be inelegant to not automate symmetry along the vertical axis. So 3 points are defined, `p1`, the bottom of the right leg at x=2 and y=0 (x=0 is the middle of the glyph, y=0 is the baseline, y=6 is the cap height), `p3` is the top middle point, and `p2` defines the middle bar. Points `p1` to `p2` are then mirrored along the vertical axis, the mirrored points starting from `p4`, and then those 5 points need to be connected to form lines, `p1` to `p3` and then `p4` to form the &#923; part of the glyph, and then `p2` to `p5` for the horizontal line. The last command is optional but quite necessary for such a glyph, it's used for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning[kerning]. Without it the glyph would be considered to have bounds at x=-2 and x=2, which in the case of glyphs such as A or T looks wrong, it makes them look like they're too far away from other letters. By setting narrower bounds the distance to other letters (which is 1.5 units by default) is reduced, in this case by 0.25 units.

=== Quasi-base 12 notation

Now you must be wondering, what's going on with the semicolons? What can "1;2;8" possibly mean? Well you see, it's nice to define points on a 4 by 6 grid, but what if you need to go finer, what if you need to put a point on a third of a unit? Should I write it as "0.33333333333333333"? That's very inelegant. We use base 10, and the problem with this is that it's only good if you want to represent halves, fifths or tenths. If you want to represent thirds, sixths, ninths or twelfths it's absolutely horrible. Unfortunately using thirds is a very essential part of geometrically designing such things as glyphs, so I wanted a better approach. I chose to represent numbers as a combination of fractions of powers of 12, separated by a semicolon. For instance 2;10;8 means 2 + 10/12 + 8/144, in other words 2.888888888888. Since it's not a strict dozenal representation it's easy to type (no need for special characters for 10 and 11), and since it's a way to represent fractions real numbers can be used to make up for the deficiencies of a dozenal system. For instance 1/60 (0.01666666) in strict dozenal notation also yields an endless number, whereas with my approach I can simply write it as 0;0.2, which means 0 + 0.2/12. It's simple and elegant.

The point `p2` of the glyph A is a good example of the need for such notation. The middle bar looked way too high at a height of 3 units, even 2.5 units looked too high, and 2 and a third seemed like a natural choice, so it was convenient to represent the height as 2;4. Then came the problem of the horizontal position, the bar has to stop right where it meets the diagonal lines. That means it has to stop at a x position of 2 * (6-(2+1/3))/6 = 1.2222222222, or 1;2;8. The number 1;2;8, by only taking 5 characters yet having full precision, fits nicely in its 8-character column. When designing things geometrically you need to think in terms of fractions and formulas, therefore a suitable representation is needed. That itself helps you in not being scared of using fractions that are inconvenient to use in decimal notation.

I also use a similar notation for angles. For geometrical design I think it's most sensible to think of angles as fractions of a full circle, using radians would be absurd, and in a way traditional notation by degrees lets you do this, but in a flawed way (because you must multiply everything by 360 and 360 isn't a multiple of 16, and frankly I'm not a fan of using a strange number like 45 to represent an eighth of a circle). If you want to represent an angle that is a third of a circle, it would make sense to represent it as 0;4. However since in geometry there is hardly any use for angles that are larger than a full circle, that means every angle in my notation would have to start with "0;". So I do away with it and simply represent a third of a circle as 4. This notation has advantages over using degrees, for instance 1/32 of a circle is 11.25&#176;, a rather awkward 4-digit number, but simply 0;4;6 in my representation, which is quite simple when you think of ";6" as simply "a half". That representation also has the benefit of matching the familiar clock face, you already know what a 2 o'clock angle looks like.

=== Curve segments, subglyphs and other advanced features

I use this notation in designing glyphs for rotations or the command called `curveseg` which defines a new point that forms a line that forms a curve by defining an angle to the previous line in the curve, and also defining a length that is either a ratio of the previous line's length or an absolute length. My design for the glyph &#1421; is a good example of this:

```
glyph 058D
	subglyph A
	p1      0       0
	p2      0       0;10;9
	curveseg p3     0;9     0;10x
	curveseg p4     0;9     0;10;3x
	curveseg p5     0;9     0;10;6x
	curveseg p6     0;9     0;10;9x
	curveseg p7     0;9     0;11x
	curveseg p8     0;9     0;11;3x
	curveseg p9     0;9     0;11;6x
	curveseg p10    0;9     0;11;9x
	curveseg p11    0;9     0;10;0;10;5x
	lines p1 to p11
	subend

	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	copy 058D A
	rotate 1;6
	move 0 3
```

It starts with a subglyph called "A" (subglyphs get a single ASCII character to identify them), a subglyph which will be copied, then the whole glyph rotated by 1;6 (one eighth of a circle or 45&#176;), this process repeated eight times and then the whole glyph moved up 3 units to be properly centered. The design of the subglyph, which is one branch of the symbol, is the most interesting. It starts with a vertical line, `p1`, the center of the whole glyph and start of this branch, and `p2`, the first point along the curve. The vertical position of `p2` defines the scale of the glyph, if `p2` was only 0;9 instead of 0;10;9 the whole glyph would be exactly the same except about 84% its current size. The point `p3` is defined using `curveseg`, and what the first parameter means is that the line p2-p3 forms an angle of 0;9 (1/16 of a circle or 22.5&#176;) with the previous line (p1-p2). The second parameter means that the line p2-p3 is 0;10 times the length of the previous line. The lines that follow are each smaller than the line that immediately precedes by a given ratio, however this ratio progressively increases. This means that while lines become smaller and smaller, their length changes less and less. As the ratio goes towards 1, the curve becomes more circular, so that while our branch starts off a bit like a logarithmic spiral, in the end it becomes almost circular. It would be impossible to design such a glyph, least of all in such an elegant manner, without a command like `curveseg`. Note that the last line, p10 to p11, had its length ratio finely adjusted so that it would stop where it meets the next branch.

More such commands are briefly described in link:rouziclib/vector_type/make_font.h[make_font.h], such as `rect` to create points that form a rectangle, `circle` to create any number of points along a circle, and commands to move, scale, rotate or shear a glyph or parts of a glyph to help in combining glyphs or subglyphs.

== RLIP - rouziclib interpreted programming

When parsing expressions with https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr[TinyExpr] didn't cut it anymore, as was the case with my image calculator, something else was needed, something that allows you to type in interpreted programs. Since it was made with my image calculator in mind you may think of it as a kind of shader language, except that it runs on the CPU.

Let's first look at how to run a basic example:

[source,C]
----
// Inputs
static double x;
rlip_inputs_t inputs[] = { RLIP_FUNC, {"x", &x, "pd"} };
const char source[] = "d v1 = cos x\n return v1";

// Compilation
buffer_t comp_log={0};
rlip_t prog = rlip_compile(source, inputs, sizeof(inputs)/sizeof(*inputs), 1, &comp_log);
if (comp_log.len)
	fprintf_rl(stdout, "Compilation log: %s\n", comp_log.buf);
free_buf(&comp_log);

// Decompilation
buffer_t decomp = rlip_decompile(&prog);
fprintf_rl(stdout, "Decompilation:\n%s\n", decomp.buf);
free_buf(&decomp);

// Execution
x = 4.;
volatile int exec_on = 1;
prog.exec_on = &exec_on;
rlip_execute_opcode(&prog);
fprintf_rl(stdout, "Program returned %.16g\n", prog.return_value[0]);
free_rlip(&prog);
----

First the inputs. We create a variable `x`, then the inputs structure which only contains the default functions plus our `x` which will also be accessed by the name `"x"`. It is defined as a type `pd` which means a pointer to a `double`. Then our source code:

```
d v1 = cos x
return v1
```

We declare a variable named `v1` as a type `d` (a `double`) which will receive the result of `cos(x)`. Here `cos` comes from a function pointer provided in `RLIP_FUNC`, it's not a builtin operation. Then `v1` is defined as a return value. Every such program must have return values, the number of which is defined by the fourth argument of `rlip_compile()`.

Then the source and inputs are compiled, which as always is a bit complicated, though I tried to keep it simple. Essentially my compiler relies on a registry to keep track of everything, and the argument to each compiled instruction is an index to one of the 3 arrays (besides the array of opcodes), namely an array of `double`, of `int64_t` and of pointers. Each opcode has specific types so it knows in which array to look for its arguments. Looking at the decompilation will make it clear:

```
op_load_d            9      41
op_func1_dd          8       6       9
op_ret_d             8
op_end
```

The first operation loads the value of `x` in the `double` array. `x` was provided as a pointer which ended up at index 41 in the pointer array, and it will be copied to index 9 in the `double` array. After this `x` won't be loaded anew (this is ensured by keeping all the load commands at the very beginning of the program so they can't be looped) and will be treated as a normal `double` variable, not a pointer to a value anymore. After this we can call `cos`, which was also provided as a pointer and is at index 6 in the pointer array. So `op_func1_dd` calls the function at the address at index 6 in the pointer array, with one argument which is from index 9 in the `double` array. It then stores the result at index 8 in the `double` array. Then this result is copied from the array to `prog.return_value`, which is how we access it.

Given that we set `x` to 4.0 before executing the compiled program we obtain the expected result:
```
Program returned -0.6536436208636119
```

Before calling `rlip_execute_opcode()` we set up something you might consider a kill switch. When `rlip_execute_opcode()` runs it constantly checks for the value pointed to by `prog.exec_on`, if it's 0 the execution stops. It's quite necessary in case you have a program that doesn't stop running on its own. Since I execute my compiled programs in a thread that also depends on a `volatile int` flag to keep running I set `prog.exec_on` to point to the same flag so that the program stops running when I signal for my thread to stop running. Programs get compiled and executed as I type them, one character after the other, so it's important that invalid programs don't get executed and that infinite loops aren't a problem. The compiler also provides very useful error messages so you always know where it chokes.

=== Language features

I tried to keep the language minimalistic and simple in syntax to keep the compiler simple. It looks more like an assembly language than anything else, and I wanted to make sure that unlike more sophisticated languages with their fancy operators you'd always know the type of the operation you're writing. For instance in C the operator `/` could be a floating-point division as well as an integer division. Few question the wisdom of doing this, yet it can be a source of undesired behaviour. To make the operator do what you want you might have to cast the arguments, which isn't very elegant. With RLIP a division is either `div` in which case all arguments are cast to `double` if necessary (using the variables named `rd1` and `rd2` for temporary storage) or `divi` in which case the arguments are made `int64_t` (using `ri1` and `ri2` if needed). This is particularly important given that arguments provided as numbers or simple mathematical expressions are interpreted as `double`. The return value can also be cast to the other type automatically using `rd0` or `ri0` as temporary storage.

Speaking of numbers and expressions, a strange feature of RLIP is that if you do something like `v1 = add v1 -1/3` this will create, in the `double` array, a variable named "-1/3" with the value you'd expect, but a variable nonetheless, so you could access that variable later by that name and give it a different value. Hardly a desirable feature, just what happens when you try to keep things simple.

Let's go through each coding feature:

- Variables are declared in the program as type `d` (`double`) or `i` (`int64_t`) the first time you use them. You can keep the `d` or `i` the next time you use the `=` operator on them but that's not necessary. A valid example:
```
d x2 = sq x
x2 = add x2 0.5
d x2 = sqrt x2
```

- Locations, which is where `goto` commands go to, are defined by a name followed by `:`. For instance `loop_start:`. Unlike with variables it's possible to `goto` a location that is defined later in the program, so both backward and forward jumps are possible.

- When using `<variable> = ...` there are a few possibilities. What follows can be a builtin command with arguments such as `v1 = sub v1 v2`, it can be a simple assignment like `i max_iter = 400`, loading a value from an input pointer, copying a value (with casting if needed) like `x1 = x_tmp`, or running a function provided as a function pointer like `d xc = clamp x`.

- Comparison is its own operation which returns either 0 or 1 as an integer and must be stored in a variable declared as type `i`. For example: `i cond1 = cmp x < 0` makes the integer variable named "cond1" contain the result of the comparison. The command `cmp` compares two arguments as `double`, the command `cmpi` as `int64_t`. This makes such things as conditional jumps based on two conditions possible:
```
i cond1 = cmpi ni < max_iter
i cond2 = cmp x2 < 4
cond1 = and cond1 cond2
if cond1 goto loop_start
```

- Other commands start directly with the command name, like the statement `if <condition integer variable> goto <location>`, or the mandatory `return <variables>` command as well as the commands of convenience `set0 <variable>` or `inc1 <variable>`, both of which have the distinction of having the operand type depend on the type of the variable, since there is only one variable that is both the source and the destination.

- Unrecognised lines are just ignored, as are things that follow the expected number of arguments, so we can have comment lines or comments appended to regular lines.

The link:rouziclib/interpreter/execution.c[execution code] makes it fairly clear what each operand does and how it is used in code.

=== RLIP fractal example

Here's a good example of what can be done with RLIP. This only takes pointers to `double` variables `x` and `y` as input, and the output is 3 values that define the pixel colour for these input coordinates.

```
// Parameters
d threshold = 4
i max_iter = 400

d x1 = 0
d y1 = 0
i ni = 0

// Fractal loop
loop:
    d x2 = sqsub x1 y1
    x2 = add x2 x
    y1 = mmul y1 x1 2
    y1 = add y1 y
    x1 = x2

    inc1 ni
    i cond1 = cmpi ni < max_iter

    x2 = sqadd x1 y1
    i cond2 = cmp x2 < threshold
    cond1 = and cond1 cond2
if cond1 goto loop
// Loop end

// Calculate colours based on iteration count
d v = log ni
v = mad v 80 1600

d red = mad v 0.036 0.2
d grn = mad v 0.0187 0.2
d blu = mad v 0.013 0.2
red = sin red
grn = sin grn
blu = sin blu
red = mad red 0.5 0.5
grn = mad grn 0.5 0.5
blu = mad blu 0.5 0.5
end:
return red grn blu
```

op_end
```

=== Custom arithmetic

We've used the `d` type for `double` variables and pointers, the `i` type for `int64_t`, but there's also a third type, `r`, and this one is whatever you want it to be. I created it so that I could use double-double arithmetic or MPFR's arbitrary precision arithmetic with RLIP, which allows me to calculate in higher precision or even use RLIP to implement code that uses MPFR, because MPFR syntax is awkward and ugly.

The file link:rouziclib/interpreter/real_functions.h[real_functions.h] shows how a custom arithmetic for RLIP can be added. Functions to do basic operations in the custom format are created and referenced in structures that are provided to the RLIP compiler. Then all that is needed is to add the macro for the chosen arithmetic to the RLIP compiler inputs like so for example:

[source,C]
----
rlip_inputs_t inputs[] = { RLIP_REAL_DOUBLEDOUBLE, RLIP_FUNC, {"x", &x, "pd"} };
----

An example RLIP program would be `const char source[] = "r v1 = cos_ x\n return_real v1";`, `v1` is declared as a `r` which is our custom real format (in this case a double-double), and `cos_` is defined in link:rouziclib/interpreter/real_functions.h[real_functions.h] as the double-double implementation of `cos`. Finally we use `return_real` instead of `return` to return the number in our format instead of `double`. We can read the higher precision result like so:

[source,C]
----
ddouble_t result = *((ddouble_t *) &prog.return_real[0]);
fprintf_rl(stdout, "{%.17g, %.17g}\n", result.hi, result.lo);
----

Which gives us the result in double-double format: `{-0.65364362086361194, 2.5846614087018284e-17}`. The same can be done with `RLIP_REAL_MPFR` without changing the `source`. We obtain the result by doing this:

[source,C]
----
mpfr_t *result = ((mpfr_t *) &prog.return_real[0]);
mpfr_fprintf(stdout, "Program returned %.60Rg\n\n", *result);
----

Giving us a very high precision result of `-0.65364362086361191463916818309775038142413359664621824700701`.

=== Expression parsing

With link:rouziclib/interpreter/expression.c[expression.c] we can parse mathematical expressions such as `0.5 + 0.5 * -cos(2pi (x-1))` into RLIP. My expression parser offers several advantages over https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr[TinyExpr] (which I would previously use extensively) which compel me to move away from the latter:

- My expression parser works with integers (which are used as results for comparisons and can be used as function arguments) and either doubles or the custom arithmetic format whereas TinyExpr only uses doubles for everything.
- Implied multiplications are supported. For instance `2x` means the same thing as `2*x` and `x cos(pi x)` the same as `x*cos(pi*x)`.
- TinyExpr parses recursively, generates a recursive data structure and the execution is also recursive, which isn't optimal for clarity and speed of execution. In contrast my parser proceeds in simple loops over a string and then a symbol array and produces a flat RLIP listing which is itself compiled into a flat list of opcodes.
- Both my expression parser and the RLIP interpreter output detailed error information, so if you have unmatched brackets you'll know it by looking at the log. TinyExpr doesn't tell you what's wrong with your expression.
- I wrote my expression parser so it's easy for me to change it to suit my needs, whereas I tried but failed to modify TinyExpr.
- My expression parser can interpret my link:#quasi-base-12-notation[dozenal numbers] as numbers, so interpreting `1;4 * 3` will give `4.0`.

An expression may be compiled and executed multiple times like so:

[source,C]
----
// Inputs
const char expression[] = "0.5 + 0.5erf(2x)";
static double x;
rlip_inputs_t inputs[] = { RLIP_FUNC, {"x", &x, "pd"} };

// Expression interpretation + compilation to opcodes
rlip_t prog = rlip_expression_compile(expression, inputs, sizeof(inputs)/sizeof(*inputs), 0, NULL);
volatile int exec_on = 1;
prog.exec_on = &exec_on;

// Execution
for (x = -3.; x <= 3.; x += 0.125)
{
	rlip_execute_opcode(&prog);
	fprintf_rl(stdout, "f(%6g) = %.16f\n", x, prog.return_value[0]);
}
free_rlip(&prog);
----

== Tools

Tools used to generate parts of rouziclib, such as the compressed typeface header, the many lookup tables or the C header containing the OpenCL code, are described link:tools/[here].

== Quick reference

This library being my own personal library, the documentation is sparse and limited to the bare minimum that I need to use it. The bulk of it is in link:quick_reference.h[quick_reference.h], which has the `.h` suffix only to benefit from syntax highlighting. I consult this file when coding something, as a sort of template. For instance if I want to draw a line, I don't remember the syntax so I just copy the line in `quick_reference.h` that says `draw_line_thin(sc_xy(p0), sc_xy(p1), drawing_thickness, white, blend_add, intensity);` and then adapt it to my needs. Same thing when I want to redimension an array as needed, I search for `alloc_enough` in the file and adapt the relevant line. It can also serve as a checklist of sorts, for instance when making threads, to make sure I haven't forgotten anything. Having templates all in one file beats looking through source code for examples of how to use a function, so having a file filled with ready to copy examples of how to use a functionality and occasionally with an explanation of what arguments do is something I recommend. I typically add code to this file when I catch myself looking more than once for an example of code of one functionality of rouziclib.
